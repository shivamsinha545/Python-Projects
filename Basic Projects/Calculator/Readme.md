Our Python calculator is a powerful tool that allows users to perform a variety of operations with multiple operands. With this calculator, users can add, subtract, multiply, divide. In the future, I will add the features like raise to a power multiple numbers in a single calculation and also a feature where users can take the square root of multiple numbers at once.

To use the calculator, users simply need to select the desired operation and enter the operands, one at a time. The calculator will then perform the operation and display the result.

This calculator is perfect for those who need to perform complex calculations with multiple operands, and it is a valuable tool for students, professionals, and anyone else who needs to do math quickly and accurately.
